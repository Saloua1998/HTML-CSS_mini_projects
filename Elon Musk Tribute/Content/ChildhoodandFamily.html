    <b>Childhood and Family</b><br />
    Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His
    mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in
    Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk,
    a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and
    property developer. Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a
    younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His maternal grandfather, Joshua
    Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian, and Musk has British and
    Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly
    lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere, a choice he made two years
    after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from
    his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every
    evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done." He has a half-sister
    and a half-brother on his father's side. Around age 10, Musk developed an
    interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He
    learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of
    a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office
    Technology magazine for approximately $500 An awkward and introverted child,
    Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a
    group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs. He attended Waterkloof
    House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from
    Pretoria Boys High School.
