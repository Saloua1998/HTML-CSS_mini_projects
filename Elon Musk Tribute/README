Goals:
- It's gotta pop
- Pretty colors
- A lot of images
- maybe a animation
- add video in it

Hours Spend: 11.5H

Things Learned:
-  Flex-flow="row wrap/column wrap"
    Itâ€™s a shortcut for flex direction and flex-wrap
- Tried using embed and iframe tags to import text files, but with both you had to scroll which didn't look nice
- To display content neatly with text on the left and an image on the right use a table
