Hours Spend: 13H

Things Learned:
-  Flex-flow="row wrap/column wrap"
    Itâ€™s a shortcut for flex direction and flex-wrap
- Tried using embed and iframe tags to import text files, but with both you had to scroll which didn't look nice
- USED I FRAME TO ADD A YOUTUBE VIDEO AND IT WORKED!!!
- To display content neatly with text on the left and an image on the right use a table
- New tag Figcaption

What I can do better next time:
- Import the text so the code isn't so long
- Learn how to combine 2 rows
- Learn how to use flexbox

Website Goals:
- Use images            (DONE)
- Add a video/animation (DONE!!!!)
- Import text from files (FAIL)
