            <h3>About</h3>
            Elon Reeve Musk born June 28, 1971 is an entrepreneur and business
            magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early
            stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder
            of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A
            centibillionaire, Musk is the richest person in the world as of
            September 2021. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African
            father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the
            University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend
            Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania
            two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics
            and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford
            University but decided instead to pursue a business career,
            co-founding the web software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The
            startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same
            year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity
            in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for
            $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace
            manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is
            CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla
            Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect,
            becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a
            solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and
            became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit
            research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In
            2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
            developing brainâ€“computer interfaces, and founded The Boring
            Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the
            Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has
            been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific
            stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was sued
            for defamation by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave
            rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same year,
            he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for
            falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover
            of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from
            his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage.
