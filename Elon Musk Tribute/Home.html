              Elon Reeve Musk born June 28, 1971 is an entrepreneur and business
              magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX;
              early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.;
              founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and
              OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest person in the
              world as of September 2021. Musk was born to a Canadian mother and
              South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He
              briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to
              Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the
              University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received
              bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
              California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided
              instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software
              company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by
              Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded
              online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form
              PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
              <br /><br />
              In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space
              transport services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. In 2004,
              he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now
              Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO
              in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy
              services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla
              Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research
              company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016,
              he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on
              developing brain–computer interfaces, and founded The Boring
              Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the
              Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system. Musk has
              been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific
              stances and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was sued
              for defamation by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang
              cave rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same
              year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission
              (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a
              private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily
              stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on
              his Twitter usage.

              <a name="part2.1"> <h4>Childhood and Family</h4></a>
              Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South
              Africa. His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and
              dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South
              Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African
              electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and
              property developer.Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972),
              and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His maternal grandfather,
              Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian, and Musk has
              British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. After his parents
              divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria
              and elsewhere, a choice he made two years after the divorce and
              subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his father,
              whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil
              thing you could possibly think of, he has done." He has a
              half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side. Around age
              10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and
              acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer programming using
              a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game
              he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for
              approximately $500. An awkward and introverted child, Musk was
              bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a
              group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs. He attended
              Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School
              before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.

              Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,
              Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born
              mother. While awaiting the documentation, he attended the
              University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed Musk to avoid
              mandatory service in the South African military. Musk arrived in
              Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in
              Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and
              lumber-mill. In 1990, Musk entered Queen's University in Kingston,
              Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of
              Pennsylvania; he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science
              degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics. In
              1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the
              summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute,
              which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage,
              and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995,
              Musk was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in
              materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk
              attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response
              to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days,
              deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet
              startup.

              In 1995, Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company
              Zip2 with funds from angel investors. They housed the venture at a
              small rented office in Palo Alto. The company developed and
              marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing
              industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that
              before the company became successful, he could not afford an
              apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and
              showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.
              According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was
              coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time." The Musk
              brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the
              Chicago Tribune, and persuaded the board of directors to abandon
              plans for a merger with CitySearch. Musk's attempts to become CEO,
              a position held by its Chairman Rich Sorkin, were thwarted by the
              board. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February
              1999. Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.

              In 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and
              e-mail payment company. The startup was one of the first federally
              insured online banks, and, within its initial months, over 200,000
              customers joined the service. The company's investors saw Musk as
              inexperienced and had him replaced with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by
              the end of the year. The following year, X.com merged with online
              bank Confinity to prevent unnecessary competition. Founded by Max
              Levchin and Peter Thiel, Confinity had its own money-transfer
              service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.
              Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference
              for Microsoft software over Linux created a rift in the company
              and caused Thiel to resign. Due to resulting technological issues
              and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and
              replaced him with Thiel in September 2000. Under Thiel, the
              company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in
              2001.] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in
              stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.7%—received
              over $100 million. In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from
              PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it has sentimental
              value.

              In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He
              was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars
              and discussed funding the project himself. In October 2001, Musk
              traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic
              missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into
              space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however,
              Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the
              Russian chief designers. The group returned to the United States
              empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to
              look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and
              were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk
              instead decided to start a company that could build affordable
              rockets. With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded
              Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May
              2002. As of 2021, he remains the company's CEO and also holds the
              title of Chief Engineer. After three failed launches, SpaceX
              succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 in 2008. It was the first
              private liquid-fuel rocket to reach Earth orbit. Later that year,
              SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services
              program contract for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon
              spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space
              Shuttle after its 2011 retirement. In 2012, the Dragon vehicle
              berthed with the ISS, a first for a private enterprise. Working
              towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015, SpaceX successfully
              landed the first stage of a Falcon 9. Landings were later achieved
              on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery
              platform. In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural
              mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.
              In 2017, SpaceX unveiled its next-generation launch vehicle and
              spacecraft system, Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), later renamed to
              "Starship", which would support all SpaceX launch service provider
              capabilities. In 2018, SpaceX announced a planned 2023 lunar
              circumnavigation mission, a private flight called dearMoon
              project. In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the
              Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place a person into
              orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS. SpaceX began
              development of the Starlink constellation of low Earth orbit
              satellites in 2015 to provide satellite Internet access, with the
              first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second
              set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece
              of the constellation occurred in May 2019, when the first 60
              operational satellites were launched. The total cost of the
              decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation
              is estimated by SpaceX to be about $10 billion.

              Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003
              by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company
              until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles
              in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.
              Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he
              invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined
              Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role
              within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not
              deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. Following a
              series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial
              crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm. Musk assumed leadership
              of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008. A 2009
              lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla
              co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others. As of 2019, Elon
              Musk is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer
              globally. Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster,
              in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first
              serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery
              cells. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in
              2012; a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015. A mass
              market sedan, the Model 3 was released in 2017. As of March 2020,
              it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than
              500,000 units delivered. A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover,
              was launched in 2020. The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup
              truck, was unveiled in 2019. Under Musk, Tesla has also
              constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle
              subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and
              Gigafactory 3 in China. Since its initial public offering in 2010,
              Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable
              carmaker in summer 2020. It entered the S&P 500 later that year.

              <a name="part3.5"> <h4>SolarCity and Tesla</h4></a>
              Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for
              SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive co-founded in
              2006. By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar
              power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the
              idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in
              Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in
              the United States. Construction on the factory started in 2014 and
              was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with
              Panasonic until early 2020 when Panasonic departed. Tesla acquired
              SolarCity for over $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its
              battery energy storage products division to create Tesla Energy.
              The announcement of the deal resulted in a more than 10% drop in
              Tesla's stock price. At the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity
              issues; however, Tesla shareholders were not informed.
              Consequently, multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against
              Musk and Tesla's directors, claiming that the purchase of
              SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense
              of Tesla and its shareholders. During a June 2019 court
              deposition, Musk acknowledged that the company reallocated every
              possible employee from the solar division to work on the Model 3,
              and, according to Musk, "as a result, solar suffered." This had
              not previously been disclosed to shareholders. Court documents
              unsealed in 2019 have confirmed that Musk was also aware of the
              company's liquidity issues. Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in
              January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.

              In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup
              company to integrate the human brain with AI. Neuralink's purpose
              is to create devices that are embedded in the human brain to

              will also reconcile with the latest improvements in artificial
              intelligence to stay updated. Such improvements could enhance
              memory or allow the devices to communicate with software more
              effectively. At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk
              described one of their early devices as "a Fitbit in your skull"
              that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other
              disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized
              these claims; MIT Technology Review described them as "highly
              speculative" and "neuroscience theater".

              early 2017, they began discussions with regulatory bodies and
              initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m)
              long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of
              SpaceX's offices as it required no permits. A tunnel beneath the
              Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021. Local
              officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.
              As a merchandising and publicity stunt, The Boring Company sold
              2,000 novelty flamethrowers in 2018. The idea was allegedly
              inspired by the Mel Brooks-directed film Spaceballs (1987).

              <a name="part4.1"> <h4>Hyperloop</h4></a>
              In 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vactrain,
              assigning a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX to establish the
              conceptual foundations and create initial designs. On August 12,
              2013, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.
              The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper
              posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs. The document scoped out the
              technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport
              system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the
              San Francisco Bay Area at an estimated total cost of $6 billion.
              The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has
              cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of
              transport for such long distances.In June 2015, Musk announced a
              design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods
              to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015–2017
              Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and
              Musk also announced that the company started a tunnel project with
              Hawthorne airport as its destination. In July 2017, Musk claimed
              that he had received "verbal government approval" to build a
              hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., stopping in both
              Philadelphia and Baltimore. Mention of the project for the DC to
              Baltimore part were removed from the Boring Company website later
              in 2021.

                <h4>Tham Luang cave rescue and defamation case</h4></a
              >
              In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a small
              rescue pod to assist the rescue of children stuck in a flooded
              cavern in Thailand. Richard Stanton, leader of the international
              rescue diving team, urged Musk in construction of the
              mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened. Named
              "Wild Boar" after the children's soccer team, its design was a 1.5
              m-long, 30 cm-wide sealed tube weighing about 41 kg propelled
              manually by divers in the front and back with segmented
              compartments to place diver weights to adjust buoyancy, intended
              to solve the problem of safely extracting the children. Engineers
              at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine out of a
              Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in 8 hours and personally
              delivered it to Thailand. However, by this time, 8 of the 12
              children had already been rescued using full face masks and oxygen
              under anesthesia and Thai authorities declined to use the
              submarine. Elon Musk was later 1 of the 187 people who received
              various honors conferred by the King of Thailand in March 2019 for
              involvement in the rescue effort, e.g. the Order of the
              Direkgunabhorn. Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who
              had been exploring the cave for the previous 6 years and played a
              key advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine on CNN
              as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with
              no chance of success, and that Musk "had no conception of what the
              cave passage was like". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device
              would have worked. He subsequently deleted the tweets, along with
              an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device,
              "Stay tuned jackass." On July 16, Unsworth stated that he was
              considering legal action. 2 days later, Musk issued an apology for
              his remarks. Then, on August 28, 2018, in response to criticism
              from a writer on Twitter, Musk tweeted, "You don't think it's
              strange he hasn't sued me?" The following day, a letter dated
              August 6 from L. Lin Wood, the rescuer's attorney, emerged,
              showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.
              Around this time, James Howard-Higgins emailed Musk claiming to be
              a private investigator and with an offer to "dig deep" into
              Unsworth's past, which Musk accepted; Higgins was later revealed
              to be a convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud. On August
              30, using details produced during the alleged investigation, Musk
              sent a BuzzFeed News reporter who had written about the
              controversy an email prefaced with "off the record", telling the
              reporter to "stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole"
              and claiming that Unsworth is a "single white guy from England
              who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40
              years... until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was
              about 12 years old at the time." On September 5, the reporter
              tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying that "Off the record is
              a two-party agreement," which he "did not agree to." In September,
              Unsworth filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles federal court. The
              defamation case began in December 2019, with Unsworth seeking $190
              million in damages. During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth
              again for the tweet. On December 6, the jury found in favor of
              Musk and ruled he was not liable.

              Musk is chairman of the Musk Foundation, which states its purpose
              is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well
              as other goals. Since 2002, the foundation has made over 350
              contributions. Around half were to scientific research or
              education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia
              Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and
              Kimball's Big Green. Vox described the foundation as "entertaining
              in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque", noting that its
              website was only 33 words in plain-text. The foundation has been
              criticized for the relatively small amount of wealth donated. From
              2002 to 2018, it gave out $25 million directly to non-profits,
              nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI, which was at the time
              a non-profit organization. In 2000, Forbes gave Musk a
              philanthropy score of 1, because he’s given away less than 1% of
              his net worth. Musk is also a trustee of the X Prize Foundation.
              In January 2021, he promised to donate $100 million as a prize to
              whomever developed the best carbon capture technology.

              Musk made $165 million when PayPal was sold to eBay in 2002. He
              was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a
              net worth of $2 billion. At the start of 2020, Musk had a net
              worth of $27 billion. Throughout that year, his net worth
              increased by $150 billion, largely driven by his ownership of
              around 20% of Tesla stock. During this, Musk's net worth was often
              volatile. For example, it dropped $16.3 billion in September, the
              largest single-day plunge in the history of the Bloomberg
              Billionaires Index.[224] In November of that year, Musk passed
              Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the third-richest
              person in the world; a week later he passed Microsoft co-founder
              Bill Gates to become the second-richest. In January 2021, Musk,
              with a net worth of $185 billion, surpassed Amazon founder Jeff
              Bezos to become the richest person in the world. Bezos reclaimed
              the top spot the following month. On September 27, 2021, Forbes
              announced that Musk had a net worth of over $200 Billion, and was
              the richest person in the world, after Tesla stock surged. Around
              three-quarters of Musk's wealth derives from Tesla. Musk does not
              receive a salary from Tesla; he agreed in 2018 to a compensation
              plan with the board that ties his personal earnings to Tesla's
              valuation and revenue. The deal stipulated that Musk only receives
              the compensation if Tesla reaches certain market values. It was
              the largest such deal ever done between a CEO and board. In the
              first award, given in May 2020, he was eligible to purchase 1.69
              million TSLA shares (about 1% of the company) at below-market
              prices, which was worth about $800 million. Musk has repeatedly
              described himself as "cash poor", and has "professed to have
              little interest in the material trappings of wealth". In 2012,
              Musk signed The Giving Pledge and, in May 2020, Musk pledged to
              "sell almost all physical possessions". In 2021, Musk defended his
              wealth by saying he is "accumulating resources to help make life
              multiplanetary [and] extend the light of consciousness to the
              stars". He owns a private jet. The jet's heavy use of fossil
              fuels—it flew over 150,000 miles in 2018—has received criticism.
              According to ProPublica, Musk paid no federal income taxes in
              2018.

              Musk met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while
              attending Queen's University, and they married in 2000. In 2002,
              their first child, son Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden
              infant death syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks. After his
              death, the couple decided to use IVF to continue their family.
              Twins Xavier and Griffin were born in April 2004, followed by
              triplets Kai, Saxon, and Damian in 2006. The couple divorced in
              2008 and share custody of their five sons. In 2008, Musk began
              dating English actress Talulah Riley, and in 2010, the couple
              married. In 2012, Musk announced a divorce from Riley. In 2013,
              Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk filed for a
              second divorce from Riley; however, the action was withdrawn. A
              second divorce was finalized in 2016. Musk then dated Amber Heard
              for several months in 2017; he had reportedly been pursuing her
              since 2012. Musk was later accused by Johnny Depp of having an
              affair with Heard while she was still married to Depp. Musk and
              Heard both denied the affair. In May 2018, Musk and Canadian
              musician Grimes revealed that they were dating. Grimes gave birth
              to their son in May 2020. According to Musk and Grimes, his name
              was "X Æ A-12"; however, the name would have violated California
              regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern
              English alphabet, and was then changed to "X Æ A-Xii". This drew
              more confusion, as Æ is not a letter in the modern English
              alphabet. The child was eventually named "X AE A-XII" Musk, with
              "X" as a first name, "AE A-XII" as a middle name, and "Musk" as
              surname. Musk confirmed reports that the couple are
              "semi-separated" in September 2021. From the early 2000s until
              late 2020, Musk resided in California where both Tesla and SpaceX
              were founded and where their headquarters are still located. In
              2020, Musk moved to Texas, stating that California had become
              "complacent" with its economic success. Musk contracted malaria in
              2000 while visiting South Africa. On the night he hosted Saturday
              Night Live in May 2021, Musk remarked that he has Asperger
              syndrome.
